Welcome to Simon Says! This file will contain the instructions on how to play.

There are two phases in this game, the flashing phase and the guessing phase.

During the flashing phase, a sequence of flashing lights will be presented.
It is the job of the user to memorize this sequence.
Once this sequence is over, the game will move on to the guessing phase.

During the guessing phase, the user will repeat the sequence of colors
they were just presented. 
Incorrectly inputting a color will end the game.
Once the user has done so correctly, another light will be added to the end of the 
sequence, which will be shown during the flashing phase.

The game will only end when the user has guessed incorrectly.

Have fun!
